# Oral-cancer-detected
üß† Project Summary

This project re-implements and extends the work from the paper titled:
‚ÄúAutomated Detection and Classification of Oral Lesions Using Deep Learning for Early Detection of Oral Cancer‚Äù.

The original study proposed using deep learning methods ‚Äî specifically ResNet-101 for classification and Faster R-CNN for object detection ‚Äî to identify oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) using mobile phone images.

Due to resource constraints, we adapted their approach with lighter models and custom implementations while maintaining performance and interpretability.

üõ†Ô∏è Design Choices & Implementation

üîπ Dataset

- **We used the Oral Cancer Images for Classification dataset from Kaggle.**

- **After cleaning (removing 40 corrupted images), we worked with 1,198 images.**

- **The images were categorized into two classes: lesion and no lesion.**

üîπ Image Classification

- **Instead of using ResNet-101, which was too heavy for our hardware, we:**

  - **Initially attempted ResNet-50 (also pre-trained on ImageNet).** 

  - **Eventually designed a custom CNN with ~456K trainable parameters.**

- **Training involved:**

  - **Input image size: 224x224**

  - **Loss: Binary Crossentropy**

  - **Optimizer: Adam**

  - **Batch size: 128**

  - **Epochs: 100**

  - **Augmentations: flipping, rotation, translation**

üîπ Object Detection

- **We implemented Faster R-CNN, similar to the paper.**

- **Used manual annotation with VIA (VGG Image Annotator).**

- **Achieved significantly better results than the paper (details below).**

üìä Results and Comparison
| Task               | Our Model               | Original Paper         |
|--------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Classification F1** | **82%** (Custom CNN)       | **87.07%** (ResNet-101) |
| **Detection F1**      | **71.79%** (Faster R-CNN)   | **41.18%** (Faster R-CNN) |
| **Mean IoU**         | **76.37%**                | Not Reported           |


üîç Notes:

- **Our classification score was slightly lower, expected due to the use of a lighter model and a smaller dataset.**

- **Our detection score was much higher, likely due to:**

  - **Better data quality (Kaggle set had more consistency)**

  - **Clean annotations**

  - **Careful tuning**
